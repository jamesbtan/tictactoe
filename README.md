# Motivation
Long term goal of learning about ML approaches to perfect information games, e.g. Chess, Go.
Here, we implement Monte Carlo Tree Search in the context of TicTacToe.

# Future goals
- Apply MCTS to more complex games: Connect 4, Chess, etc.
- Enhance MCTS with a heuristic, rather than a random walk
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search with Heuristic Evaluations using Implicit Minimax Backups:
    [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.0486)
- Train a policy rather than an explicit heuristic
  - Keywords:
    - PPO
    - DQN
    - Reinforcement learning
